## Expontential Decay Model of Memory Retention
This repository contains a little shiny app to illustrate the Expontential Decay Model of Memory Retention. I made this app for the lecture "FS Bayesche Statistik". Feel free to fork this repository and to customize it for your purpose.

### Run the App
Simple type the following commands into your R REPL:
```R
library(shiny)
runGitHub("trybnetic/shiny_edm")
```
**Please note:** You need to install the R-package `shiny`.
